# Telecom-Customer-Churn
The Telco Customer Churn Analysis project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) application developed using R and the tidyverse suite of packages. This project aims to analyze customer churn data to uncover patterns and insights that could help reduce churn rates. The dataset is meticulously examined for missing values, and various visualizations are created to explore the relationships between customer demographics, services used, and churn status. Key features include bar plots for categorical variables, box plots for continuous variables, and correlation matrices. Ultimately, the project seeks to provide actionable insights that can inform strategies for improving customer retention in the telecommunications industry.
